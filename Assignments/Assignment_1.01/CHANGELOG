August 21, 2018 - Initialized CS327 Project

August 25, 2018 - Tested Atom, Vim, Emacs, VSCode, and CLion

August 26, 2018 - Decided on VSCode, though, Vim was a close second. Also set up version control with Git and GitHub.

August 28, 2018 4:00PM - Initialized Knights Tour with psudocode provided by instructor
August 28, 2018 4:30PM - Attempted to use an algorithm I found in a book to help with the knights Tour
August 28, 2018 4:45PM - Gave up on algorithms book version
August 28, 2018 5:30PM - Created a cool algorithm to find all the possible moves a knight can do
August 28, 2018 7:30PM - Trying to figure out how to finish the knights tour algorithm
August 28, 2018 10:00PM - Getting segementation faults and can't figure out why
August 28, 2018 11:00PM - Still getting seg faults and tired.

August 29, 2018 10:30AM - Realized my "cool algorithm" actually sucks, so got rid of that
August 29, 2018 4:30PM - Thinking I have a problem with recursion never ending, so trying to make a base case
August 29, 2018 5:00PM - No longer getting seg faults and printing a single line with 25 numbers, the numbers are wrong
August 29, 2018 6:00PM - Can't figure out anything, looking up algorithms online and found an algorithm that is VERY close so using that to help finish
August 29, 2018 9:00PM - SO, I tried for several hours to get this damn thing to work but nothing seems to help and I don't know what I'm doing wrong
August 29, 2018 10:00PM - Wrote my Makefile, CHANGELOG, and README and calling it. I'm not sure what to do from here
August 29, 2018 9:30PM - Created base directory for all assignments
August 29, 2018 9:45PM - Initialized DungeonGenerator project and added high level TODO
